# Responsive Layout Plan for Monitor Selection UI

This document outlines the comprehensive responsive layout system for handling different monitor configurations in the monitor selection interface.

## Overview

The responsive layout system automatically adapts the monitor selection dialog to accommodate various monitor arrangements, from simple dual-monitor setups to complex multi-monitor configurations with different orientations and sizes.

## Layout Analysis System

### Configuration Detection

The system analyzes monitor configurations using several key metrics:

1. **Aspect Ratio Analysis**
   - `aspect_ratio = total_width / total_height`
   - Horizontal: `aspect_ratio > 2.0` (wide arrangements)
   - Vertical: `aspect_ratio < 0.5` (tall arrangements)
   - Mixed: `0.5 <= aspect_ratio <= 2.0` (balanced arrangements)

2. **Complexity Assessment**
   - Simple: 1-2 monitors
   - Moderate: 3-4 monitors
   - Complex: 5+ monitors

3. **Spatial Bounds Calculation**
   ```python
   min_x = min(screen.geometry().x() for screen in screens)
   min_y = min(screen.geometry().y() for screen in screens)
   max_x = max(screen.geometry().x() + screen.geometry().width() for screen in screens)
   max_y = max(screen.geometry().y() + screen.geometry().height() for screen in screens)
   ```

## Responsive Dialog Sizing

### Base Dimensions
- Default: 800x600 pixels
- Minimum: 600x400 pixels
- Maximum: 1400x1000 pixels

### Configuration-Based Adjustments

#### Horizontal Arrangements
```python
width = min(1200, base_width + monitor_count * 100)
height = base_height
```
- Optimized for side-by-side monitor layouts
- Wider dialog to accommodate horizontal spread
- Maintains reasonable height for UI elements

#### Vertical Arrangements
```python
width = base_width
height = min(900, base_height + monitor_count * 80)
```
- Optimized for stacked monitor layouts
- Taller dialog to accommodate vertical spread
- Maintains reasonable width for readability

#### Mixed Arrangements
```python
width = min(1000, base_width + monitor_count * 50)
height = min(800, base_height + monitor_count * 40)
```
- Balanced approach for complex layouts
- Moderate increases in both dimensions
- Scales with monitor count

### Complexity Scaling

For complex configurations (5+ monitors):
```python
width = min(width * 1.2, 1400)
height = min(height * 1.2, 1000)
```
- 20% size increase for better visibility
- Capped at maximum dimensions
- Ensures adequate space for all monitors

## Adaptive Scaling System

### Scale Factor Calculation

The system calculates optimal scale factors based on:

1. **Available Space**
   ```python
   available_width = dialog_width - 100  # UI margins
   available_height = dialog_height - 250  # Title, buttons, margins
   ```

2. **Configuration-Specific Scaling**
   - **Horizontal**: `scale = min(scale_x, scale_y * 1.2, 0.25)`
   - **Vertical**: `scale = min(scale_x * 1.2, scale_y, 0.25)`
   - **Mixed**: `scale = min(scale_x, scale_y, 0.2)`

3. **Minimum Scale Enforcement**
   - Complex configurations: `min_scale = 0.05`
   - Simple configurations: `min_scale = 0.08`

### Widget Sizing Constraints

#### Minimum Dimensions
- Width: 150 pixels
- Height: 110 pixels
- Ensures readability of monitor information

#### Maximum Dimensions
- Capped by scale factor limits
- Prevents oversized widgets in simple configurations

## Layout Positioning System

### Coordinate Transformation

1. **Normalization**
   ```python
   rel_x = screen.geometry().x() - min_x
   rel_y = screen.geometry().y() - min_y
   ```

2. **Scaling**
   ```python
   scaled_x = int(rel_x * scale_factor)
   scaled_y = int(rel_y * scale_factor)
   ```

3. **Positioning**
   ```python
   final_x = scaled_x + margin_x
   final_y = scaled_y + margin_y
   ```

### Margin Management

- **Base Margins**: 50 pixels (x and y)
- **Responsive Adjustment**: Based on dialog size
- **Minimum Clearance**: Ensures widgets don't overlap
